/// Initializes the sqflite FFI (sqflite_ffi) backend for tests.
///
/// By default, the `sqflite` plugin expects to run on a mobile
/// platform (Android/iOS) with native bindings. In widget/unit tests,
/// however, we donâ€™t have access to those native layers.
///
/// Calling this method switches the database implementation to
/// `sqflite_ffi`, a pure Dart/FFI version of sqflite that works on
/// desktop and in test environments. After this, any call to
/// `openDatabase` will use the in-memory FFI-backed database instead
/// of trying to talk to a missing native platform.
///
/// Usage:
///   void main() {
///     setupTestDatabase();
///     // ... now run tests that open/use a sqflite database.
///   }

  sqfliteFfiInit();
